## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a video streaming service using machine learning. I built a **Logistic Regression model** with **feature engineering and pipeline-based preprocessing**, achieving a **ROC AUC score of 75.1%**. The goal is to identify high-risk churn customers early, enabling the business to take proactive retention measures and reduce revenue loss.

## **Dataset Details**  
- **Training Data:** 243,787 records  
- **Test Data:** 104,480 records  
- **Features:** Subscription details, payment methods, content preferences, usage behavior, and demographics  
- **Target Variable:** `Churn` (Binary: 1 = Churn, 0 = Retained)  

---

## **Approach & Methodology**  

### **1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
- Handled missing values and ensured data consistency.
- Converted binary categorical variables (`Yes/No`) into numeric form.
- Applied **One-Hot Encoding** to categorical features using `ColumnTransformer`.

### **2. Feature Engineering**
- Engineered relevant features from subscription type, user activity, and preferences.
- Created new insights from existing attributes to improve model performance.

### **3. Model Development**
- Used **Logistic Regression** within a **pipeline** to streamline preprocessing and training.
- Optimized hyperparameters (`max_iter = 1000`, `C=1.0`, `solver=lbfgs`).
- Evaluated model performance using **ROC AUC score**.

### **4. Results & Business Impact**
- Achieved a **75.1% ROC AUC score**.
- Provided insights to help the business implement **targeted retention strategies** and reduce customer churn.

### **How the Business Problem is Solved with Logistic Regression**  

The core business problem was to **identify customers at high risk of churning** from the video streaming service. By using a **Logistic Regression model with feature engineering and preprocessing**, we achieved the following key outcomes:

 **Early Churn Prediction**:  
- The model predicts **churn likelihood for each customer**, allowing proactive retention strategies.  
- With a **75.1% ROC AUC score**, it effectively differentiates between customers likely to churn vs. stay.  

 **Data-Driven Decision Making**:  
- The model provides insights into **which customer segments** (e.g., payment methods, subscription types, content preferences) are more likely to churn.  
- This helps in **tailoring marketing efforts** and **offering personalized retention incentives**.  

 **Cost Reduction & Revenue Growth**:  
- **Preemptive retention strategies** (e.g., discounts, content recommendations) can be targeted at high-risk users.  
- Preventing churn directly translates to **higher customer lifetime value (CLV)** and **reduced acquisition costs**.  

 **Scalability & Automation**:  
- The pipeline-based model can **easily be updated** with new data, making it scalable for future use.  
- It can be deployed as an **API or integrated into a CRM system** for **real-time churn prediction**.  

### **Conclusion**  
This solution aligns with the business objective by **enabling strategic interventions** before customers churn, leading to **higher retention, improved profitability, and sustained user engagement**. ðŸš€
